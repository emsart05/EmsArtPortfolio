            Hey! Do you fucking hate ferrets? I know I sure as hell do. That's why my close friend and I have created 
            a business that disinegrates and destroys ferrets! Does your kid, roommate, or spouse have a pet ferret that annoys the living shit 
            out of you? Just hate ferrets? Call or email us for a free consultation about exterminating your ferret(s) NOW!<br><br>
            It has been my dream, ever since I was just a young little lad, to exterminate the ferret species. I have
            always had a particular hatred for them in my heart and I'm not sure why. However, this hatred is shared between
            my partner and I. We both wish to commit genocide of the ferret species. If you also share this hatred, please 
            contact us and let us put your ferrets to death in the more horrific way imaginable; it would be a great pleasure for us.<br><br>
            Don't let our name fool you; we offer many methods of extermination, not just disinegration! We also offer burning alive, poisoning, drowning, dropping from
            a great height, torture, gas, stabbing, strangling, a quick euthanization, and many more! Prices range from roughly $20 to $1,000 depending on your preferred method and the number of ferrets. More details
            will be given in our colsultation, which will either be over the phone or through email (preferrably phone).<br><br>
            Please help us in our mission to completely exterminate all ferrets worldwide. Share this page with your friends and family 
            who also hate ferrets. If anyone <em>you </em> know has a ferret, steal it and bring it to <em>us</em>. We promise you won't be
            disappointed.
