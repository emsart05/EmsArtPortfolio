            Like a rush shot through you
            Everyone is watching you
            Told you why I see no need for the sun
            (I've found a reason to say)
            A love you light is a love soon gone
            If this is it
            Don't bother cause <br>this love is a lie
            I'm a chemical kid
            You're a mechanical bride
            (When every vein is red out of the blue)
            I held a diamond to the sun
            To count the moments on account of the way you
            Smile, smile for me
            (Oh, we're in slow motion when you)
            Smile, smile for me
            But, oh my God, I've been looking
            But I still hold your breath so you won't leave
            Pastel-red and porn star-white
            Ghost on the altar
            We breathe, don't leave
            Say that the night sings alone
            And if there's a God
            Then I'm letting Him go
            All for you, you alone
            Raise my hands
            At the thought of you leaving me alone
            What if I... what if I
            What if I, I still care?
            Don't torture me or beg me<br>
            Can you make me believe in tiring?
            As you fall fast asleep, it reminds me
            Of the slow symphonies behind me
            (They sing along)
            All the nightmares you'll see tomorrow
            All the stars on your ceiling
            They glow but not for you
            Through the trees, I'll blow
            Congratulations, break a leg tonight
            What a shame I heard the understudy died under the knife
            Crying backwards under bedroom lights
            (The operation)
            <br>
            I don't think you'll ever want to love me
            You'd better listen to your doctor, doctor
            Sober up and bury the empty cup
            In a backyard of Seattle we used to lie

            When I sew you up, don't let me...
            Stop bleeding
            Tiny stitches that you placed into my skin
            Won't let me go (Oh no, oh no)
            And they're ruining the mood

            So I'll toast every beat of my heart like a miracle

            And I don't think you'll ever want to love me
            You'd better listen to your doctor
            Doctors lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
            If the dollar is right
            Oh, my sweet little girl
            Hold your mouth and you'll be all right

            (Gather round, gather round!)
            Ladies and gentlemen
            Come from far come from wide
            The moment you've all been waiting for
            Tonight, join us as we explore the spine-chilling mystery of death
            And the miracle of resurrection!
            <br>
            Please understand me when I'd rather see you dead
            Than live without me, so thirsty for more

            Beyond the sea blue light
            I met the love of my life
            She'd rather see me dead than face me
            I like your starry eyes
            They yell, "Surprise, surprise!"
            I'm in love, but not for long

            (Our operation)
            Call off the operation
            (Our operation)
            Call off, off, off...

            Another wave has turned its back on me
            Crashed back on the eyes of the first I see
            (If your delicate eyes don't blink someday)
            Can't count on anything
            (They might as well be gone)
            For you I'd count the salt under the sea
        </p>
