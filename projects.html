            <strong style="font-size: 30px">My Coding Projects</strong><br><br>

                (As of <date>2/5/2022</date>) I only started coding a few weeks ago, so I haven't made anything very
                good yet, but I have made a few things. This is page is where I am going 
                to display those projects. The only one that won't be on here is this 
                website; the website you were currently on is my most current project. 
                I will be linking the source code for each project (except this one). 
                Some may have specific instructions on how to open the file or what things 
                do and don't work on the page, so be sure to pay attention. Some may have 
                multiple files; if so, it will be a compressed zip folder. Also, the screenshots 
                in the sidebar are in order with the projects listed.<br><br>

            <!--Portfolio-->
            <strong style="font-size: 30px">Art Portfolio</strong><br><br>

                This was my first ever project. I added onto it as I was learning HTML and CSS. 
                None of the navbar links will work; I changed the href to the links on my old 
                website that isn't up anymore. Also, most of the pictures won't show up because 
                I had to chop the zip folder size to less than 25mb to upload it to GitHub.  
                Once it has downloaded, unzip the folder and open the "portfolio.html" to view 
                it in your browser. Open it (as well as the other files) with a code editor to view the source code.<br>
                <strong>Source code: </strong><a href="portfolio-site.zip" download>portfolio-site.zip</a><br><br>

            <!--Survey-->
            <strong style="font-size: 30px">About You Survey</strong><br><br>

                I made this with CodePen to as one of my projects to get my responsive web design certificate 
                on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>. None of the elements are responsive, 
                meaning nothing will happen when you click the submit button. Kind of ironic considering it was a "responsive" 
                web design project. This is not a download link, it is going to take you to CodePen.io to view the 
                project as well as the source code. <br>
                <strong>Source Code: </strong><a href="https://codepen.io/emsart05/pen/ExbjXrQ" target="_blank">codepen.io</a><br><br>

            <!--Nutsack-->
            <strong style="font-size: 30px">Nutsack</strong><br><br>

                This is a random thing I made with my mom. I used this as a way to walk her through the basic steps of 
                building a website. We had some fun with it. It is another zip folder, so follow the same steps as the 
                art portfolio. Everything should be the same except the home page will be "index.html". And all the navbar 
                buttons should work.<br>
                <strong>Source code: </strong><a href="nutsack.zip" download>nutsack.zip</a><br><br>

            <!--Ferret Disintegrators-->
            <strong style="font-size: 30px">Ferret Disintegrators</strong><br><br>

                I made this site recently and based it on a "company" that a friend and I made in middle school as a joke. All of the navbar links should work 
                and actually have content on all of the pages. None of the information on the "contact" page is real. This is another 
                zip folder, and the home page is once again "index.html". <br>
                <strong>Source code: </strong><a href="ferrets.zip" download>ferrets.zip</a><br><br>

            <!-- Web Art -->
            <strong style="font-size: 30px">Web Art</strong><br><br>

                I'm still working on this (and I want it to be a legit functional project), so instead of adding a zip file, I added this to the website.
                So I'm giving you the link. This is currently the only place on this site to access the Web Art section.<br>
                <strong>Link: </strong><a href="emiscringe.ml/ok/index.html">web art home page</a><br><br>
